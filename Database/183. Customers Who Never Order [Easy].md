183. Customers Who Never Order

Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers.

+----+-------+  
| Id | Name  |  
+----+-------+  
| 1  | Joe   |  
| 2  | Henry |  
| 3  | Sam   |  
| 4  | Max   |  
+----+-------+  
Table: Orders.

+----+------------+  
| Id | CustomerId |  
+----+------------+  
| 1  | 3          |  
| 2  | 1          |  
+----+------------+  
Using the above tables as example, return the following:

+-----------+  
| Customers |  
+-----------+  
| Henry     |  
| Max       |  
+-----------+  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

select Name as Customers
from Customers
where id not in (select distinct CustomerId from Orders);

select Customers.Name Customers
from Customers left join Orders on Customers.id = Orders.CustomerId 
where Orders.id is null;

select Name as Customers
from Customers
where not exists (select * from Orders where CustomerId = Customers.id);

Note: 

in, not in 需要注意效率问题，具体情况具体分析。简单SQL中not in和not exists可能会被优化为相同的执行路径。
